            <h3>Crminal Laws</h3>
            <p> Criminal law is the body of law that relates to crime. It prescribes conduct perceived as
                threatening,
                harmful, or otherwise endangering to the property, health, safety, and moral welfare of people inclusive
                of 
                one's self. Most criminal law is established by statute, which is to say that the laws are enacted by a
                
                legislature. Criminal law includes the punishment and rehabilitation of people who violate such laws.
                

                Criminal law varies according to jurisdiction, and differs from civil law, where emphasis is more on
                dispute 
                resolution and victim compensation, rather than on punishment or rehabilitation. 

                Criminal procedure is a formalized official activity that authenticates the fact of commission of a
                crimebr <br>
                and authorizes punitive or rehabilitative treatment of the offender. 
            </p>

            <h3>
                Principles of criminal law </h3>
            <p> The traditional approach to criminal law has been that a crime is an act that is morally wrong. The 
                purpose of criminal sanctions was to make the offender give retribution for harm done and expiate his
                <br>
                moral guilt; punishment was to be meted out in proportion to the guilt of the accused. In modern times
                
                more rationalistic and pragmatic views have predominated. Writers of the Enlightenment such as Cesare
                
                Beccaria in Italy, Montesquieu and Voltaire in France, Jeremy Bentham in Britain, and P.J.A. von 
                Feuerbach in Germany considered the main purpose of criminal law to be the prevention of crime. With the
                
                development of the social sciences, there arose new concepts, such as those of the protection of the
                <br>
                public and the reform of the offender. Such a purpose can be seen in the German criminal code of 1998,
                
                which admonished the courts that the “effects which the punishment will be expected to have on the 
                perpetrator’s future life in society shall be considered.” In the United States a Model Penal Code 
                proposed by the American Law Institute in 1962 states that an objective of criminal law should be “to
                <br>
                give fair warning of the nature of the conduct declared to constitute an offense” and “to promote the
                
                correction and rehabilitation of offenders.” Since that time there has been renewed interest in the 
                concept of general prevention, including both the deterrence of possible offenders and the stabilization
                
                and strengthening of social norms.</p>
           <h3> Types of Criminal Laws </h3>
            <p> There are two types of criminal laws: misdemeanors and felonies. A misdemeanor is an offense that is
            considered a lower level criminal offense, such as minor assaults, traffic offenses, or petty thefts.
            Moreover, in most states, the penalty for the misdemeanor crime is typically one year or less.

            In contrast, felony crimes involve more serious offenses. Some examples of felonies include murder,
            manslaughter, dealing drugs, rape, robbery, and arson. In virtually every state in the U.S., felonies carry
            a penalty of one year or more, depending upon the particular nature of the offense and the jurisdiction
            where the felony crime was committed. In addition, every state has a different body of criminal laws which
            vary from state to state. There are also federal criminal law statutes which apply to every state in the
            U.S. </p>
