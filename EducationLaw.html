                <h3> What Is EducationLaw </h3>
                <p>
                    Education Matters was first established in 1987 as a newsprint publication. Its purpose was to
                    provide an independent non-partisan platform for teachers, parents and all those interested in
                    education – a space that would:
                    offer relevant news, information, analysis;
                    enable the exchange of ideas;
                    encourage mutual professional support;
                    facilitate a sense of community and collegiality amongst educators.
                    Education Matters quickly established itself as a quality publication, covering breaking news and
                    providing in-depth analysis of the big issues in education. Over the years it was carried as a
                    supplement by various national newspapers including The Sunday Times and The Sunday Tribune.
                    Contributors included Dr Anthony Clare, Gemma Hussey, Cynthia Ni Mhurchu, Vivian Cassells, Louis
                    O’Flaherty, Dr Eileen Doyle and other well-known and respected writers.

                    In 2000-01, Education Matters transferred to the internet and re-launched itself as an education
                    news website with weekly alerts of new content sent by email to signed-up subscribers. The new
                    electronic format had many advantages; in particular it provided easier access to a high-quality
                    fast-reading information resource, which could now be read online or offline.

                    In 2013, as technology leaps ahead and broadband is now the norm in schools, colleges and homes,
                    EducationMatters.ie is moving into a primary position as an information resource for busy educators
                    who wish to keep abreast of current news and trends. Here you will find:

                    A digest of education news collated from various media in Ireland and around the world;
                    Features on issues and subjects close to the hearts of teachers and parents;
                    Blogs by professionals who are willing to share their expertise with fellow educators;
                    Forthcoming events – lectures, competitions, funding deadlines, seminars, conferences; </p>


                <h3> What the civil law is: </h3>
                <p> A comprehensive system of rules and principles usually arranged in codes and easily accessible to
                    citizens and jurists.
                    A well organized system that favors cooperation, order, and predictability, based on a logical and
                    dynamic taxonomy developed from Roman law and reflected in the structure of the codes.
                    An adaptable system, with civil codes avoiding excessive detail and containing general clauses that
                    permit adaptation to change.
                    A primarily legislative system, yet leaving room for the judiciary to adjust rules to social change
                    and new needs, by way of interpretation and creative jurisprudence. </p>
                <h3>Some salient features of the civil law:</h3>
                <p> Clear expression of rights and duties, so that remedies are self-evident.
                    Simplicity and accessibility to the citizen, at least in those jurisdictions where it is codified.
                    Advance disclosure of rules, silence in the code to be filled based on equity, general principles,
                    and
                    the spirit of the law.
                    Richly developed and to some extent transnational academic doctrine inspiring the legislature and
                    the
                    judiciary. </p>
                <h3>Where we find the civil law: </h3>
                <p>In Continental Europe, where most jurisdictions have civil codes. In Great Britain, Scotland has
                    retained an uncodified form of the civil law. Even when they have civil codes, Scandinavian
                    countries are
                    not regarded as civil law jurisdictions.
                    In North America, civil codes are found in Louisiana and Quebec.
                    In Central and South America, almost all countries have civil codes.
                    In Asia, many countries have received the civil law and have civil codes, such as Indonesia, Japan,
                    Kyrgyzstan, and Lebanon.
                    Countries of Africa that once were colonized by continental European nations have kept many aspects
                    of the
                    civil law traditions. The Civil Code of Egypt has a significant influence in Africa and the Middle
                    East,
                    whilst the Roman-Dutch law applied in South Africa was never codified.
                    Some remnants of the civil law traditions are to be found on some Pacific islands, especially in the
                    French
                    territories of New Caledonia or Tahiti.
                    In mixed jurisdictions, chiefly found in America, Africa, and Asia, but also in Europe, the civil
                    law
                    coexists with other legal traditions such as the common law, customary law, or Islamic law.</p>
