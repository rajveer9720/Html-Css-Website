            <h3>Family Laws</h3>
        <p>Family law is a legal practice area that focuses on issues involving family relationships such as marriage,<br>
            adoption, divorce, and child custody, among others. Attorneys practicing family law can represent clients in <br>  
            family court proceedings or in related negotiations. They can also draft important legal documents such as 
            court <br> petitions or property agreements. <br>

            Some family law attorneys even specialize in adoption, paternity, emancipation, or other matters not usually <br>
            related to divorce. The matter of family encompasses so many life aspects. Lawyers in the field, therefore, <br>
            help all kinds of people facing all kinds of sensitive issues that many people wouldn't immediately assume <br>
            go under the family law umbrella.

            The following is a primer on family law and what it entails.

            <h3> Helpful Terms to Know </h3>
            <p> Emancipation: A court process through which a minor becomes self-supporting, assumes adult responsibility <br>
            for their personal welfare, and is no longer under the care of their parents. <br>
            Marital Property: Property acquired by either spouse during the course of a marriage that is subject to <br>
            division upon divorce.
            Alimony: An allowance made to one spouse by the other for support during or after a legal separation or <br>
            divorce.
            Paternity: Origin or descent from a father (to establish paternity is to confirm the identity of a child's <br>
            biological father).
            Prenuptial Agreement: An agreement made between a man and a woman before marrying in which they give up <br>
            future rights to each other's property in the event of a divorce or death.</p>
             <h3>Reasons to Hire a Family Law Attorney</h3>
            <p> Most family lawyers represent clients in divorce proceedings and other matters related to divorce. But <br>
            family law is a relatively broad practice area, including such issues as foster care and reproductive <br>
            rights. Since family law matters hit so close to home, having a trusted legal professional by your side can <br>
            help you ensure your loved ones are properly represented and protected during any legal process. <br>

            The most common reasons to hire a family law attorney include: <br>

            Divorce: Each partner hires their own attorney, who will help devise a settlement plan in order to avoid a <br>
            trial. Divorce attorneys typically are skilled at dividing marital property, calculating spousal support, <br>
            and proposing a plan for child custody, visitation, and support (if applicable). <br>
            Child Custody / Child Support: Court orders and settlement agreements involving both custody and support <br>
            usually are included in the larger divorce case, but may be revisited as conditions change. For instance, <br>
            child support may be altered after the non-custodial parent's financial situation changes. <br>
            Paternity: In most cases, paternity cases are filed by the mother in an effort to secure child support <br>
            payments from an absent father. But sometimes biological fathers file for paternity in order to have a <br>
            relationship with their child. Paternity typically is determined through DNA testing. <br>
            Adoption / Foster Care: Adoption is a complex process that differs according to the type of adoption, where <br>
            the child is from, variances in state laws, and other factors. Therefore, it's important to consult with a <br>
            family law attorney. Foster parents sometimes adopt their foster children, but the foster process does not <br>
            necessarily require legal representation.</p>
            <h3> Related Practice Areas</h3>
             <p> Family law often intersects with a wide range of other legal practice areas. For example, instances of <br>
            domestic violence and child abuse typically involve criminal investigations (and may result in arrests and <br>
            charges). Along with that process, family courts are tasked with determining how to best protect the victims <br>
            and ensure a relatively safe environment for those involved. Other related legal practice areas include the <br>
            following: 

            Mediation and Collaborative Law
            Estate Planning 
            Immigration and Naturalization Law <br> </p>
            <h3> Marriage and Divorce Laws Vary by State</h3>
            <p> States have the right to determine "reasonable formal requirements" for marriage, including age and legal <br>
            capacity, as well as the rules and procedures for divorce and other family law matters. <br>

            The timeframe of the divorce process, for example, depends on location. Some states have divorce laws that <br>
            require a waiting period. Same-sex marriage has historically been a state matter. Prior to the Supreme Court <br>
            ruling legalizing same-sex marriage, some states restricted marriage (and divorce) to opposite-sex couples <br>
            only. <br>

            <h3> Need Help With a Family Law Matter? Talk to a Professional </h3>
            <p> Whether you're in the process of a divorce, need help with an adoption, or have questions about enforcing a <br>
            child support order, it's often in your best interests to work with an attorney. Get the help you need by <br>
            contacting an experienced family law attorney near you.</p>
